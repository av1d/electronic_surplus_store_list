This is a list of electronic surplus stores and soldering kit stores which sell items online.
To fit the criteria the store must sell some form of electronics such
as surplus, components, devices or soldering kits.
One focus is also to draw attention to small electronic businesses which are disappearing rapidly.
Many of these places offer competitive pricing and we recommend seeing what they have to offer.
Ideally this list will end up categorized by components/devices/computer/radio and so on.
This is a work in progress and what you see right now is just the basic foundation.
The list mostly lacks organization whatsoever and is in no particular order.

You may use this list and these files for anything including commercial purposes. We do ask that you link back to this repository.
The reason for linking is so that others can contribute and help it grow which helps everyone.

Please leave comments, post in 'issues' or make pull requests to add sites / make updates.
To do: add brief descriptions of site contents. Do further organization.

Miscellaneous / components / diy / tools
Basically this is an alternative source of compenents. Stores have more of a neighborhood electronics store feel than a huge corporate chain vibe.
These places can often have hard to find and unique parts as well. Some of these places are duplicated from the lists above.
