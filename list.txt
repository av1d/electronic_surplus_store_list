This is a list of electronic surplus stores which sell items online.
To fit the criteria, the store must sell some form of surplus electronics such
as components or devices. There are a few radio places tossed in here.
Ideally this list will end up categorized by components/devices/computer/radio and so on.
I would like to add lists of traditional soldering kit makers/sellers as there are still
quite a few in existence.

Leave comments in 'issues' or make pull requests to add sites.
